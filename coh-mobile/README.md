## Mobile App

- cd into the `/CommunitOfHope/coh-mobile` directory
- run `yarn` for first time setup
- run `npx expo start` to launch the app
- open on the web or scan the QR code with Expo Go App to launch on your phone.  Note: For me this doesn't work unless my phone and computer are connceted to the same wifi network.
  
## Git Instructions

- First, ALWAYS `git pull` before you make changes.
- `git branch [Name of Branch]` to create a new branch
- `git checkout [Name of Branch]` to move into your newly created branch
- `git add [filename]` to track changes in individual files or `git add *` to track changes in all files.
- `git commit -m "[Commit Message Here]"`.  Use your commit message to give a brief description of what you worked on.
- `git push`, if it tells you to rerun the command again with `--set-upstream`, then copy the code they give you in that error message and run it.
- Finally, go onto the CommunityOfHope Github and create a pull request.
