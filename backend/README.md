# Setup Instructions

- cd into the `/CommunityOfHope/backend` directory.
- run `npm install` for first time setup
  
### Everytime you want to run the backend do the following:

- cd into the `/CommunityOfHope/backend` directory.
- run `npm run go` to launch the app
- make sure it says "In Development Mode", if not something is run with the .env file


# Git Instructions

- First, ALWAYS `git pull` before you make changes.
- `git branch [Name of Branch]` to create a new branch
- `git checkout [Name of Branch]` to move into your newly created branch
- `git add [filename]` to track changes in individual files or `git add *` to track changes in all files.
- `git commit -m "[Commit Message Here]"`.  Use your commit message to give a brief description of what you worked on.
- `git push`, if it tells you to rerun the command again with `--set-upstream`, then copy the code they give you in that error message and run it.
- Finally, go onto the CommunityOfHope Github and create a pull request.
